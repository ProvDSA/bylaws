We hold critical and independent thought to be essential for a democratic movement. Disagreement between members is not only expected but desirable, and we seek to foster constructive and comradely dialogue across these differences in a way that includes and respects each person.

# ARTICLE III — Membership

## Section A — Membership Rights

The membership as a corporate body is the sovereign authority in Providence DSA, the bylaws express its will and it elects as delegates the officers. Each member has the right to attend and participate in official Providence DSA meetings and public events. Each member has the right to speak in meetings, within the bounds, to be determined by the membership and enforced by moderators, of equitable, inclusive, and democratic discussion. Each member has the right to propose action items and amendments to the bylaws, and to vote on such decisions.

## Section B — Membership Location

Membership is extended to any DSA member who is current on dues to the national office, or has requested a hardship waiver, and resides in the geographic area served by the Local. A member of DSA residing outside the geographical area served by the Local may be granted membership on two conditions: that they agree to and do participate regularly in the activities of the local; and that they are not a voting member of another DSA local. A majority vote of current Local members is required to grant such extraterritorial membership.
 
## Section C — Membership Removal

A member may be removed from membership by submitting a letter of resignation, or for the following reasons:
- Non-payment of dues (unless a hardship waiver has been requested)
- Harassing another member;
- Advocating illegal violence or terrorism;
- Disrupting meetings;
- Being under the discipline of a self-defined democratic-centralist organization (e.g.  “vanguardist” organizations).
 
If a member is to be removed from membership for any reason other than their resignation, the member shall be notified by the Executive Committee after a majority of the Executive Committee votes to move to remove the member. The member shall have the right to defend themselves in front of the membership during a special meeting, and shall only be removed following a ⅔ vote of members present at the defense.

In cases of contested races, elections will be conducted by secret ballot; where a candidate runs unopposed, simple acclamation suffices. Each position will be filled by a majority vote. In cases of multiple candidates yielding no winner with a majority, a runoff vote will be held immediately thereafter between the two candidates with the most votes.

# Section K — Recall Procedure

Executive Committee members remain accountable to the Local membership throughout their terms. Any member may, on grounds of nonfeasance or malfeasance, call for a recall election of any Executive Committee member(s) at an official meeting with a quorum. If a total of five or more members join in calling for such a recall election, challengers may be nominated for the contested seat(s). If one or more challengers are nominated for a seat, an election will immediately follow according to the procedure described above. If no challengers are nominated, the incumbent retains his or her position by default. 

# ARTICLE VIII — Amendment

These bylaws may be amended or replaced with the approval of two-thirds of the voting membership present at an official meeting with a quorum. At the request of any one or more members, an amendment vote will occur using secret ballot. No amendment may be introduced and voted on at the same meeting.
