# ARTICLE III — Membership

## Section A — Membership Rights

The membership as a corporate body is the sovereign authority in Providence DSA, the bylaws express its will and it elects as delegates the officers. Each member has the right to attend and participate in official Providence DSA meetings and public events. Each member has the right to speak in meetings, within the bounds, to be determined by the membership and enforced by moderators, of equitable, inclusive, and democratic discussion. Each member has the right to propose action items and amendments to the bylaws, and to vote on such decisions.

## Section B — Membership Location

Membership is extended to any DSA member who is current on dues to the national office, or has requested a hardship waiver, and resides in the geographic area served by the Local.

A majority vote of current Local members is required to grant such extraterritorial membership.

- Disrupting meetings;
- Being under the discipline of a self-defined democratic-centralist organization (e.g.  “vanguardist” organizations).
 
If a member is to be removed from membership for any reason other than their resignation, the member shall be notified by the Executive Committee after a majority of the Executive Committee votes to move to remove the member. The member shall have the right to defend themselves in front of the membership during a special meeting, and shall only be removed following a ⅔ vote of members present at the defense.

Members of the Election Committee should not be running for positions enumerated in Article VII, Section A in order to have a clear, independent election.

The Election Committee shall self organize responsibilities, elect it's own leadership, and work under the democratic principles that guide Providence DSA.

The Election Committee has the power to:

- Create a voter roll of eligible members
- Provide information to candidates about role responsibility
- Notify membership of elections
- Provide information about candidates to the membership
- Set up the voting process from a technical and procedural standpoint
- Notify the Executive Committee and membership of the voting outcomes

Candidates must be nominated by Local members.

Candidates are elected by the Local membership using instant runoff voting.

In cases of contested races, elections will be conducted by secret ballot using the process laid out by the Election Committee.

Where a candidate runs unopposed, simple acclamation vote suffices.

Each position will be filled by the winners of the election organized by the Election Committee.

If a position is vacant, at any time the Executive Committee may call a special election for that position or membership may, by the same powers of recall in Section K, call a recall election on the vacant seat.

# Section K — Recall Procedure

Executive Committee members remain accountable to the Local membership throughout their terms. Any member may, on grounds of nonfeasance or malfeasance, call for a recall election of any Executive Committee member(s) at an official meeting with a quorum. If a total of five or more members join in calling for such a recall election, challengers may be nominated for the contested seat(s). If one or more challengers are nominated for a seat, an election will immediately follow according to the procedure described above. If no challengers are nominated, the incumbent retains his or her position by default. 

All recall elections must follow the voting rules as listed in Section J.
